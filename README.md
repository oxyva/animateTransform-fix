jQuery SVG animateTransform fix
===============================

Currently IE9 does support SVG but does not parse the 
animateTransform tag. Keith Wood has created a jQuery plugin
called jQuery SVG which allows you to apply the jQuery animate 
function on SVG elements (http://keith-wood.name/svg.html). 

jQuery SVG combined with this IEfix plugin allows IE9 to 
animate the elements with animateTransform of an inline SVG 
image.
